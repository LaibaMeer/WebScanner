# WebScanner

Web security is a critical aspect of modern applications, as vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats. This project aims to develop a Python-based web vulnerability scanner to identify and analyze security weaknesses in web applications. The scanner will leverage Python’s powerful libraries, including requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, to automate the detection of common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and misconfigured security headers. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, the tool will generate comprehensive reports, enabling developers and security analysts to address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.  

The proposed scanner will be designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, making it suitable for integration into development workflows and security assessments. It will incorporate an intuitive user interface and allow for customization based on specific security needs. Additionally, the tool will be open-source, ensuring adaptability and continuous improvement through contributions from the cybersecurity community. This project will not only provide hands-on experience in cybersecurity and Python programming but also contribute to the ongoing efforts in securing web applications against evolving threats.
